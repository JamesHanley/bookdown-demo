## Objectives

This **central** chapter addresses a **fundamental concept**, namely the **variance of a random variable**. It gives the laws governing the variance of a sum of 2, or (especially) $n$ random variables  -- and even more importantly -- the laws governing **the variance of a difference of two random variables.** The latter is  central, not just to simple contrasts involving just 2 sample means or proportions, but also in the much wider world of regression, since the variance (sampling variability) of any regression slope can be viewed as the **variance of a linear combination of** random 'errors', or random deviations, or **random variables**.   So, if there is one 'master' formula to pay attention to and to 'own', it is the one for the variance of a linear combination of random variables. All others are special cases of this.

So, the **specific objectives** are to truly understand

* the concept of  a random variable.

* the concept of the (expectation and) variance of a random variable.

* why it is that, when dealing with the sum  of two or more independent random variables, it is not their standard deviations that sum (add), but rather their variances.

* likewise, why it is that, when dealing with the **difference**  of two independent random variables, or some **linear combination** of $n$ independent random variables involving positive and negative weights, **why the component variances add**, and **with what weights**.

3. continued

   + Use  your searching skills to find the formal statistical name for the distribution of $Y$, which can take on the values $y$ = 0, 1, $\dots$, 6. 
   + Likewise, find the name of the `R` functions (`d??p?r` , `p??p?r`, `q??p?r` and `r??p?r`) that allow you to obtain the 7 probabilities, the 7 cumulative provabilities, the quantiles, and the `r??p?r` function that draws random values from this distribution.
   + Even with knowing what the full (numerical) probability distribution of $Y$ is, it is possible, just from the marginal totals for the 2 x 2 table, to calculate the expected value of $Y.$ Do so. (_Hint_: look up 'expected values for r x c tables')
   + Just by imagining what the full probablility distibution on the integers 0 to 6 must look like [or by looking at the material earlier on this page], come up with an approximate value of the variance of Y. [If you look up this distribution in Wikipedia, you wiull find the exact formula for it.]  
   
4. The chapter on inference possible relates  the '**Lady Tasting Tea**' story. You could put the possible outcomes of the trial into this 2 x 2 table involving 8 cups of tea, into which the milk had been poured first in 4 instances, and second in the other 4. The lady was told there were 4 of each, so she indicated the 4 into which she jusged the milk was poured 1st, and the 4 into which she judged the milk was poured 2nd.  

Frequencies of the correctness/incorrectness of the replies by the lady (rows) in relation to the truth arranged by experimenter (columns)

|        | ALL   |  |  4 cups   |      | 4 cups   |      |  8 cups  |    |

4. continued

   + Use the `R` function `d??p?r` to obtain, under the null hypothesis, the 5 probabilities for $y$.
   + Under this null, what is the probability of getting **at least 3** correct?
   + What if 12 cups (6 and 6) were used? What then would be the probability of getting **at least 5** correct? **all 6**?

5. **Saving** on the numbers of binary yests **by pooling**. When a binary blood test [one that yields a positive ('+ve') or negative ('-ve') result] gives +ve results in only a small proportion, $\pi,$ of blood samples, it may be possible to economize on the costs of testing by pooling m blood samples, according to the following procedure: (i) each blood sample is divided into two portions; one portion is kept in reserve while the other is pooled with the corresponding portions from $m$ - 1 other blood samples (ii) if the result of a single test on the pooled bloods is -ve, each of the $m$ individual blood samples are considered -ve; if the result is +ve, then the $m$ reserve bloods are individually tested.
   
   + With $m$ = 20 and $\pi$ = 0.1, calculate the expected number of tests required to determine the status of eack of the blood samples. (_Hint_: a tree diagram may help)

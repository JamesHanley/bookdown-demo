# (PART) Part I {-}

# Statistical Parameters {#paras} 

## 3 parameters [rows] in 3 simplest settings [columns]

See the grid below. 

**Rows** 

* $\mu$ Level(s): e.g.,  mean depth of ocean or height of land

* $\pi$ Prevalence or risk (proportion): e.g.,  proportion covered by water

* $\lambda$ Speed with which events occur: e.g., earthquakes per earth-day

**Columns** 

* Single (global) e.g. entire surface of the earth, or entire oceans 

* Parameter contrast: e.g Southern hemisphere [reference category] vs Northern hemisphere [index category]; categories are represented by (say) North = 0 (i.e. Southern, i.e., not Northern) vs. North=1 (i.e. Northern)

* Parameter gradient: over (quantitative) levels of X

**Notes**

* In setting 1: there is just 1 parameter (dot)

* In setting 2, there are 2 parameters, one for the reference category and one for the index category. How they relate to each other can be can be expressed in a number of different ways. A common and useful way is via a **parameter equation** that contains a parameter for the reference category and a comparative parameter (some measure of the difference between the two parameters) -- the latter is often of most interest

* In setting 3, the **parameter equation** traces the parameter over a continuum, using as many coefficients as are needed
